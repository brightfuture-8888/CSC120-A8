Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    It reflects Person's life. Person takes those action verbs to follow Contract. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    I did not use additional methods.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I had a little bit of hard time creating number method just because I haven't created it before. Other than making number method, I liked how we could have freedom to just explore codes and make whatever we want to.
